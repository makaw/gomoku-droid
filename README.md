# Gomoku 4 Android
Android version of my [Gomoku desktop project](https://github.com/makaw/gomoku). 
It's already quite playable! But still needs some work.

### Gomoku
Gomoku (alias "Five in a Row") is an abstract strategy board game. 
It is played with black and white stones on a board with 15x15 intersections. 
Players variably place their stones on a board. The goal is to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
